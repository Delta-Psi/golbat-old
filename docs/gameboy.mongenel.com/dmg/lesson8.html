<h2> ASMSchool - Lesson 8</h2>
<h3>First Things First</h3>
Welcome to Lesson 8. This lesson will detail a few things that you need to know, layouts, etc. 
Just a bunch of miscellaneous shit I think you should know about. First, I'm going to show you 
the basic layout of a source file and an include file. I'll show you the sections that should be in 
your source code, and a few assembler directives that you'll use alot.<br><br>

At this point, you should know what the <a href="gbspec.txt" target="_blank" class="tableheader">PANDOC</a> is, and have a copy of it handy. It contains all the juicy hardware details that I wont bother boring you with just yet.<br><br>

This <a href="blankasm.txt" target="_blank" class="tableheader">skeleton source file (click for link)</a> is very 
basic but it's a very clear, concise layout. Click on that link to open up the file in a new window. 
<br><br>

Taking a look at the skeleton source file, you'll notice that it's got a few sections; the file 
description, a section for includes, a section for equates, a section for constants, the header 
section, and the code section. The header section is the really important part, as this is needed 
for every GameBoy program.<br><br>

Ok, this source file is really really plain, but it's the bare minimum that you'll need. As it stands, 
the file will compile into a ROM and run on a GameBoy, but all it will do is run in a loop, since 
that's all the code thats in it. The header area has a few sections in it that define specific locations 
for certain things. If you look over it, you'll notice the Restart (RST) vectors at the beginning from 
$0000 to $0038. These are locations that are jumped to if the CPU happens upon a RST $XX 
opcode. Basically, they are used in routines as a fast CALL, since a normal CALL opcode takes 3 
bytes and an RST only takes one byte. Usually, an RST will either have a very short routine, 
only a few bytes long, since there are only 8 bytes between each RST (eg: $00, $08, $10, $18, etc). 
Sometimes, if you need a routine a little bit longer than 8 bytes, you can place a JP (jump) at the 
RST that jumps to your other routine, but TAKE NOTE that jumping is a 3 byte long instruction 
and defeats the purpose of speed in a RST.<br><br>

Ok, now the next few sections are the Interrupt Vectors. You'll notice that in the SECTION 
directive, there are two operands: a NAME for the section and a LOCATION of the section. 
The SECTION directive is an RGBASM directive, since I'll be using RGBDS in my lessons. 
Notice that all of the Sections so far are in the HOME bank (bank 0) at the location specified in 
the brackets. The header sections MUST go in these specific locations in Bank 0. Ok, those 
interrupt vectors are locations that the CPU will jump to if certain hardware conditions are met. 
These hardware conditions are easily enabled/disabled by setting the corresponding bits in the 
IE (located at $FFFF) register. If I wanted to enable the V-Blank Interrupt, I'd just set bit 0 of IE to 
1 and once the LCD hits v-blank (which it does 60 times per second), the CPU would disable all interrupts then jump to 
$0040, which would usually have a "JP VBlankRoutine" which just jumps to a routine that I 
want to run every v-blank. The reason that the CPU disables interrupts when an interrupt 
happens is so that one interrupt can't interrupt another interrupt already in progress... sounds 
scary doesn't it? Many games use the v-blank as a timer to control game speed. The 
other interrupts work just the same way, and all the details of them can be found in the 
<a href="gbspec.txt" target="_blank" class="tableheader">PANDOC.</a> Since my blank simple source doesn't need 
to use any IRQ's, I've placed a RETI instruction at each of them, which just returns from the 
interrupt condition (RETI = Return and Enable Interrupts).<br><br>

After the IRQ's there is a little bit of free space up until $0100. That's where the GameBoy starts 
executing from the cartridge. But there is only 4 bytes of space here before the Logo Data section 
starts, so normally there are two instructions placed here, a NOP followed by a JP START. Since 
the header area ends at $0150, START is usually located here. You'll notice that in the source 
file, that my START has a SECTION directive that places it in Bank 0 at $0150. It's a good normal 
place to put it. Of course, I kinda skipped over the cart info section, which is pretty much self-explanatory. 
It's just the logo data, cart name and a few things that define the cart hardware. No sweat.<br><br>

Getting back to $0150, this is where everything really starts. All I've put here is a simple JP START 
that just jumps back to itself and basically accomplishes nothing except for teaching you a few 
things about the basic layout of an ASM source file.<br><br>

Hm... well I think that's about it, it's time to move on to lesson 9. I know I'll think of something 
to add here later... shit happens. I know this might sound a little goofy to you, but READ THIS 
LESSON AGAIN. Why? Because you'll better remember the layout if you review it once more. 
Think of it as a homework assignment... but a hell of alot easier. =)<br><br>
