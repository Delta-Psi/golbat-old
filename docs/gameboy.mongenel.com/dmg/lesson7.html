<H2>ASMSchool  -  Lesson 7</H2>
<h3>What the hell is RGBDS and WLA?</h3>
This lesson will introduce you to the assemblers of choice among GB asm coders. Both RGBDS and WLA 
are great packages for turning your code into a ROM image. Both include an assembler, linker, etc. All 
the tools you'll need. I WILL NOT put one head and shoulders above the other, since both have their own 
plusses and minuses. Currently I use RGBDS, but I have used WLA and I like that one just as much.<br><br>

Ok, if you haven't already, go download RGBDS and WLA. You're definately going to need them. And you might 
want to get CGBIDE also, just so I know what kind of editor you're using ;-).<br><br>

First we'll work with RGBDS. You should have these files, either in the same directory as your source, 
or pointed to in your DOS PATH:<br><br>

If you don't know what a DOS PATH is, just stick the files in the same directory as your source code. 
These files don't have to be that specific size, there is a plain DOS version, and a version compiled 
for Win9X console (DOS box in Windows) so the file sizes may not match. No worries, mon!<br><br>

Ok, you'll see that we have 4 EXE's. RGBASM is the assembler, it takes your code and converts it to the 
correct data objects that XLINK turns into a final ROM image. RGBFIX is a cleanup tool. What it does is 
takes a ROM image and corrects internal header information (checksum, name, filesize, etc) and can pad 
or truncate the rom image to an appropriate size (32, 64, 128, 256, 512K, etc). I haven't really used 
XLIB.EXE, though I'm sure it has something to do with managing libraries of code. =P<br><br>

Ok, lets jump right in and take a look at the batch file that I use in one of my projects.<br><br>
<table bgcolor="#000000"><tr><td><PRE><FONT color="#00FF00">

I REALLY hope you know how to use batch files and the DOS Prompt. If not, STOP READING NOW and go get 
"DOS For Dummies", a great book for all of you kids who were raised in a GUI world...<br><br>

The first 7 lines are just running the assembler on several source files for my project. My project is 
split up into multiple files for clarity and simplicity, plus if I only make one small change in one 
of the source files, I only have to recomile that specific source file. The syntax for RGBASM is pretty 
simple, and I've used the simplest form here, just an input and output file. Obviously the 
"-o&lt;filename&gt;" tells the assembler what file to write the output to, and the second operand is just 
the source file.<br><br>

The next line "xlink -mtest.map -ntest.sym link1" invokes the linker to put together all of the objects 
that RGBASM created from the source files. The "-mtest.map" option tells the linker to output a map file named "test.map", 
which is basically a little text detailing everything in the ROM, and the "-ntest.sym" option tells the 
linker to output a no$gmb compatible SYMbol file called test.sym, so that when I load the ROM in the no$gmb debugger, 
it will show the labels from my source code so it's easier to debug. The symbol file must have the same 
name as the ROM image, or else no$gmb wont know where to load the symbol file from. More information on 
the format of the sym file and other no$gmb options can be found in it's help file (open the emu and press F1). 
And the option on the very end is the link script. The link script tells the linker all of the object files 
to put together into a ROM and what name to give the output.

Now we have a ROM image, but we aren't quite done yet. In the next line of the batch file I use RGBFIX 
to check the ROM image header and correct any information that needs to be done, such as checksums, the Nintendo 
logo data, etc. And then the last line of the batch file just renames the map file to a TXT file so I can 
open it easily in Notepad and take a look.
<br><br>
&lt;IMPORTANT NOTE&gt; The logo data in the header is a VERY touchy subject. Nintendo has staunchly 
defended the idea that this logo data is their property, since it draws out the Nintendo logo when the GB powers up. 
Nintendo claims that using this piece of data without their prior authorization is a violation of copyright laws. 
Unfortunately, the ROM image MUST contain a correct header to run the game. There has been legal precedent 
that it is not illegal to include such a "signature" on the basis that it is an anti-competetive practice. 
Sega and Accolade were involved in a lawsuit over the same issue. Accolade produced a game for the Genesis 
game console without the prior consent of Sega, and distributed the game. The game included a signature 
that the Genesis checks to make sure it's an authorized game, even though the game had NOT been approved by Sega. 
The judge ruled in favor of Accolade stating that Sega was being anti-competetive. Of course, the game package 
didn't have Sega's "Seal Of Approval" on the front of it, but the game ran nonetheless. You'll find that in 
many game consoles, there is a note in the instruction manual saying something to the effect that using any 
game not approved for use on the console isn't authorized, etc... It's pretty much bullshit strongarm tactics 
to get the consumer to think of non-approved games as possible damaging to your game system. So, you REALLY 
have to watch yourself in homebrew game development to make sure you stay clear of copyright issues. &lt;/IMPORTANT NOTE&gt;<br><br>

Ok, now we've made it through our first make file. Now lets run it and see what happens! Just type MAKE 
if you're at a DOS prompt, or double-click the batch file if you're using Windows Explorer.

WOW! if you see the word SUCCESS in your assembling, that's a GOOD THING. =) It means that the assembler 
didn't have any MAJOR issues with your sourcecode, such as syntax errors. Ok, now that you've watched me 
compile one of my projects, you sorta know how things will go when you start assembling your own projects.<br><br>

Well, now I've run into a problem. I've spent this whole afternoon writing this tutorial, now I'm tired 
as hell and I haven't even touched on the WLA assembler yet... (sorry Ville!) Well, in actuality WLA is very 
similar to RGBDS, it's just a little different. Plus, WLA will assemble for a few different CPU's, not just the 
GameBoy.<br><br>

That's the end of this lesson. The next lesson will be along shortly... =)
