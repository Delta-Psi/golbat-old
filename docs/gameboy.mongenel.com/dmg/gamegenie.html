The Game Genie is designed to replace Cartridge ROM bytes
with user entered values. It doesn't actually modify the information in
the Cartridges themselves. GameBoy Games just ACT like the ROM has been
modified.

<P>This is the format for Game Genie codes for GameBoy:

Late model Game Genies only require you to enter the first six digits.
All nine digits are required for selecting a specific rom bank.

<P>The DD above is the Replace Value. AB above is the old byte value in
ROM to be replaced. Since there are different ways of selecting rom banks,
the only way for the Game Genie to determine which byte to replace in which
ROM bank is by comparing what's in ROM to the Compare Value. If these match
up, then the replace value is put on the data bus. Otherwise the old ROM
data is presented to the GameBoy.

<P>The AB compare value is encoded. To restore it's original value invert
AB (xor $ff), rotate value right by 2, then invert bits 0, 2 and 6 (xor
$45).

<P>The C value above is still undetermined but if you XOR it with encoded
nibble A the result must not be any of the values 1 through 7 or else you
will receive a bad code message. Usually this value will be 8 when decoded.

<P>The Game Genie can only modify/replace ROM addresses 0002 to 7FFF. The
most significant nibble in the address (3 above) is complemented. (i.e.
it is entered as a complemented value.) ( Values:0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 --> Complement
equivalent:F,E,D,C,B,A,9,8) Values of 0 - 7 are not allowed for the most
significant nibble as these are above memory locations 7FFF.

<P>From my testing I've concluded that six digit codes affect every ROM
bank. (i.e. a code that affects address 7000 will also affect virtual addresses
0F000, 17000, 1F000, 27000, etc.). This probably is not a problem for most
games since graphics are usually put in these extra banks &amp; minor 'flaws'
introduced into these banks would probably hardly be noticeable. This WOULD
heavily affect Multi-game cartridges though that may have code in every
bank.
